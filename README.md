# Sub-Downloader
Simple subtitle downloader script using http://www.opensubtitles.org/ <br>
Made this python script for my own personal use so it's currently quite bare and simple. Might add more features in the future listed under [TODO](https://github.com/kneekill/sub-downloader/new/master?readme=1#todo).

## Usage
- Download using the button on the top right  and unzip the file
- Install [Python 2.X](https://www.python.org/getit/)
- Use Command Line / Terminal to run the script (python /File/Path/To/Download/main.py)
> Windows users will have to add python to their [filepath](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-7)
- Enjoy!

## TODO
- Multiple Lang support
- Search via movie name
- GUI?
